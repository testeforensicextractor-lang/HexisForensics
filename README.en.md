## What it is

**Hexis Forensics** is a tool for the routine work of device forensics: collect what
answers the examination, record how each piece of data was obtained and deliver
documents that stand on their own.

- **Android** — address book, calls, SMS and MMS, media, WhatsApp (via the backup
  with a 64-digit key), system artifacts, diagnostic report.
- **iPhone** — local backup, common or encrypted (which brings the call log), with
  decryption, messages, address book, WhatsApp and photos.
- **USB drives and disks** — logical copy, Windows artifacts and a volume image,
  with a write blocker.
- **Hash sealing** — the SHA-256 of each file is computed at the moment of
  acquisition, and integrity can be checked at any time.
- **Documents** — Extraction Report, Content Report (with the photo locations),
  PDF of selected conversations and the Expert Report.
- **Examination without extraction** — the report of the locked or damaged device,
  with the same chain of custody.

## The principles

1. **Never assert what was not verified.** When a piece of data is not obtained, the
   document says why. The absence of a piece of data in the material is never
   presented as its absence on the device.
2. **Every change to the device is recorded and justified.** The modules that modify
   the device start unchecked and leave a record of what was done.
3. **What is necessary, well recorded.** Collect what matters to the examination and
   document the provenance of each piece of data.

## How to install

### Option 1 — Installer for Windows (recommended)

1. Download the installer on the [download page](https://github.com/HexisForensics/HexisForensics/releases/latest).
2. **Verify the hash.** In the file's folder, open the Terminal and type
   `Get-FileHash .\HexisForensics-Setup-1.0.0.exe`. For **version 1.0.0**, the
   result must be identical to:

   ```
   de4abda974d2a0267df98ba461fefb4e4eadd8f0cf52950c9c2ce7ba5723c5bf
   ```

   If a single character differs, **do not run** the file. The same value is in
   the `.sha256` next to the installer on the releases page.
3. Run the installer. As it has no paid digital signature, Windows shows
   **"Windows protected your PC"**: click **More info** and then **Run anyway**.
4. On the first run, register your examiner profile and save the password
   **recovery code**.

> On some computers, **Smart App Control** on Windows 11 blocks the installer
> **without** offering the "Run anyway" button, because it has no digital signature.
> In that case, install on another computer, ask your IT department to allow the
> program, or use **Option 2** below.

### Option 2 — Run from source

When the installer is blocked and there is no way to allow it, the tool runs directly
from source, like any open-source project. It takes a few more steps, but it does not
depend on a digital signature.

1. Install **Python 3.13** ([on the downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
   choose version **3.13** — **not** 3.14, which one of the iPhone libraries does not
   support yet). On the first screen of the Python installer, check
   **Add python.exe to PATH**.
2. Download the **source (ZIP)** of the tagged version, on the
   [releases page](https://github.com/HexisForensics/HexisForensics/releases)
   — **not** the "Code → Download ZIP" from the main page, which brings the development
   version. Verify the ZIP's hash (`Get-FileHash .\HexisForensics-1.0.0-fonte.zip`),
   identical to the one published in the Release, and extract the folder.
3. Open the extracted folder, right-click an empty space and choose
   **Open in Terminal**.
4. Install the libraries and open the tool:

   ```
   py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   py main.py
   ```

The `adb.exe` already comes in the ZIP, so Android extraction works with no extra step.
Cases are kept in **HexisForensics-Casos**, in your Windows user folder — the same as
the installed version, **outside** the program folder, so that updating (downloading the
new ZIP) never reaches the acquisitions.

The [manual](docs/User_Manual_Hexis_Forensics_EN.pdf) explains each step, with the
screens; the **Quick Extraction Guide** above is also in English.

**Requirements:** Windows 10 or 11 and a USB data cable. For iPhone, the
**Apple Devices** app (Microsoft Store) or iTunes.

## Where version 1.0 was proven

| Device | System |
|---|---|
| Motorola moto x4 | Android 9 |
| Samsung Galaxy A22 | Android 13 (One UI 5.1) |
| Android emulator, with elevated privilege | Android 13 |
| iPhone 11 | iOS 18.6.2 |
| USB drive | Windows 11 |

Other models tend to work by the same route, but were not verified.
**Known limitation:** the agent app has not yet been verified on **Xiaomi, Redmi and
POCO** devices. The full list of limitations is in the manual.

## What the tool does not do

It does not unlock devices, does not bypass passcodes, does not perform physical
extraction of a phone without elevated privilege and does not recover deleted data. For
those cases there are specialized tools.

## For developers

The code is organized in three layers (`core` → `services` → `ui`), with an automated
test suite. To run the suite, see **Option 2** above and run the tool from source. The
technical documentation is in [docs/DESENVOLVIMENTO.md](docs/DESENVOLVIMENTO.md) (in
Portuguese).
